# js_popup-oldskool
Sometimes you need an old skool popup box, or a custom alert/notification/tooltip that you can't get other ways (meaning you don't know enough CSS).

Feel free to modify, especially if you can make the alerts and tooltips prettier. Use as you wish.

Download all the files to the same directory on your computer and launch the example_pops.html file to see the demos.

It even comes with a generator file (IE is best for it) to make code creation easier.
