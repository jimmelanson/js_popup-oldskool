Zydeco's rural beginnings and the prevailing economic conditions at its inception are reflected in the song

to be the first modern zydeco recording, though the term "zydeco" was not in use yet (see 1954 in music).
After Chavis left the music business, <a href="#" onmouseover="showspecial(event,'cliftonchenier');">Clifton Chenier</a> became the first major zydeco star and also led to
the invention of the word zydeco in 1965. One of his hits was "Les Haricots Sont Pas Salés" (The Snap Beans
Aren't Salty — a reference to the singer being too poor to afford salt pork to season the beans) and he said
that "Zydeco" was a corruption of les haricots (<a href="#" onmouseover="g.powerTip(this,event,'<b>French:</b><hr>French is a Romance language spoken originally in France, Belgium, and Switzerland, and today by about 175 million people around the world as a mother tongue or fluent second language, with significant populations in 54 countries.',400,120,0);">French</a> for the beans).
